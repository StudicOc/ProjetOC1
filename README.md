# Projet_2_OC
First website to build on CSS, without JS, libraries or jquery.

The reservia site allows users to find accommodation and activities in the city of their choice. Accommodation can also be treated by theme, for example their budget or their atmosphere.

The design of the site was developed with a layout on the Flexbox, in order to follow a good integration of the model.

The hierarchy of the site is based on the new semantic HTML5 tags for better accessibility of content for people requiring site reading software to consult the web, but also this will allow indexing robots to better interpret your web page, and therefore target the actual content that you want to highlight.


Tools :
Model mirror, delimitation of zones.
SEO strategy and techniques of html5.
Responsive design, analysis of screen adaptation.
